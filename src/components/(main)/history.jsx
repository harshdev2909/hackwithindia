                    There will be 2 rounds in the hackathon. On the first day, Round 1 will begin with participants giving an abstract and presentation on their idea, followed by Round 2 of the mentorship process. Only the shortlisted teams will be in round 2 which is prototyping. After the results of round 2 finalists will give the presentation to the judges on the second day and the winner of the contest will be declared.
